### Introduction

This is the final project of our course in ZJU, with the joint effort of 5 groups.

We build a stock trade system where you can buy or sell stocks. 

Our group develop the front-end interface and interact with the other groups of back-end.

This project was made with **React.js** (create-react-app) and **ant design**.
